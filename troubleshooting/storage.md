# 🐳 Podman Runtime – Issue 102

## 🚨 Insufficient Storage for Remote Engine Container Image

```shell
Error: writing blob: adding layer with blob "sha256:..." unpacking failed (error: exit status 1; output: open /usr/share/zoneinfo/zone.tab: no space left on device)
docker run return code: 125.
```

---

## 💡 Root Cause

Podman stores container layers, metadata, and volumes in `/var` by default. For Remote Engine installation, it is recommended to have **at least 50 GB of free space** in `/var`.

Check available space:

```bash
df -h /var
```

**Example output:**

```shell
Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/xvda4      8.8G  42.4G  52.8G  81% /
```

---

## ✅ Resolution Options

### Option 1: Clean Up Container Storage

Free up disk space by removing unused container images:

```bash
podman system prune
```

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This will remove **all unused images**, including those that were manually pulled but aren't currently running.

> [!TIP]  
> Confirm with the user before executing, especially in environments where image cleanup could impact other workloads.

---

### Option 2: Modify Container Storage Location

If `/var` is full, use another mounted volume for container storage.

---

#### 🔧 Part 1: Mount a New Volume

1. Check available volumes:

    ```bash
    lsblk
    ```

2. Format the new volume (e.g. `/dev/xvdb`):

    ```bash
    sudo mkfs.xfs /dev/xvdb
    ```

3. Mount the volume:

    ```bash
    sudo mkdir -p /mnt/data
    sudo mount /dev/xvdb /mnt/data
    ```

4. Make it persistent after reboot:

    ```bash
    sudo nano /etc/fstab
    ```

    Add this line:

    ```text
    /dev/xvdb /mnt/data xfs defaults 0 0
    ```

> [!NOTE]  
> You can validate with `df -h` to confirm `/mnt/data` is mounted correctly.

---

#### 📁 Part 2: Set Up Storage Directories

```bash
# For rootful Podman
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/data/containers/storage_root

# For rootless Podman
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/data/containers/storage_rootless
```

If you’re unsure, create both.

---

#### 🔐 Part 3: Set SELinux Context (Rootful Only)

Check if SELinux is enforcing:

```bash
getenforce
```

If it returns `Enforcing`, run:

```bash
sudo semanage fcontext -a -e /var/lib/containers/storage /mnt/data/containers/storage_root
sudo restorecon -R -v /mnt/data/containers/storage_root
```

> [!NOTE]  
> SELinux adjustments are **not required** for rootless containers.

---

#### 👤 Part 4: Adjust Ownership for Rootless Podman

If the user is `amin`, grant permissions:

```bash
sudo chown -R amin:amin /mnt/data/containers/storage_rootless
```

---

#### ⚙️ Part 5: Edit `storage.conf`

Open the config:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/containers/storage.conf
```

- For **rootful** users, change:

    ```ini
    graphroot = "/mnt/data/containers/storage_root"
    ```

- For **rootless** users, uncomment and change:

    ```ini
    rootless_storage_path = "/mnt/data/containers/storage_rootless"
    ```

---

### ✅ Final Step: Verify Configuration

Check that Podman recognizes the new storage paths:

```bash
podman info
```

Look for this in the output:

```text
store:
  graphRoot: /mnt/data/containers/storage_rootless
  ...
  volumePath: /mnt/data/containers/storage_rootless/volumes
```

---

> [!SUCCESS]  
> You’re all set! The Remote Engine container image should now install without storage-related errors.

✅ You’re all set! The Remote Engine container image should now install successfully using the new storage path.
